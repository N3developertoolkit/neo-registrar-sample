## Manually Installing Neo Blockchain Toolkit for Neo 3 preview 4

For Neo 3 preview 4, the Neo Blockchain Toolkit VS Code extensions (Neo Visual DevTracker and the
Smart Contract Debugger) are not available via the VS Code Marketplace. In the meantime, if you
want to install the extensions manually, you can download the preview 4 compatible versions via
wget as shown below:

``` shell 
> wget https://github.com/neo-project/neo-debugger/releases/download/1.2.58-preview/neo-contract-debug-1.2.58-preview.vsix
> wget https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo3-visual-tracker/releases/download/v0.5.424-preview/neo3-visual-tracker.vsix
```

The downloaded VSIX files can be installed in VS COde as per the
[official VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix)
